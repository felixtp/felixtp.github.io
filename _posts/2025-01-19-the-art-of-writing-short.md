Sometimes the most powerful ideas come in small packages.

Twitter taught us that 280 characters can change the world. Hemingway could break your heart in six words. The best insights often arrive not in thousand-word treatises, but in the quiet moments between thoughts.

Yet we're obsessed with length. Blog posts need to be 2000 words for SEO. Books need to be 300 pages to feel substantial. We equate depth with verbosity.

This is backwards.

The best writing doesn't fill spaceâ€”it creates it. It gives your mind room to breathe, to think, to make connections. It respects your time and intelligence.

Every word should earn its place. Every sentence should advance the idea. Every paragraph should feel necessary.

This doesn't mean all writing should be short. Complex ideas need space to unfold. But even then, every word matters.

Write like you're paying by the word. Because in attention, you are.
